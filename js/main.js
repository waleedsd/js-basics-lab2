// EXERCISE 1
// Write a function named squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
function squareNumber(number) {

}
let number = 7;
let result = number**2;
console.log(`The result of squaring the number ${number} is ${result}`)


// EXERCISE 2
// Write a function named halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
function halfNumber(numberToBeDevided){

}
let numberToBeDevided = 68;
let result2 = numberToBeDevided/2; 
console.log(`Half of number ${numberToBeDevided} is ${result2}`)
   

// EXERCISE 3
// Write a function named percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
function percentage(num, per)
{

}
let num=1200;
let per = 50/100
let result3 = num*per;
console.log(`${result3} is 50% of the number ${num}.`);

// EXERCISE 4
// Write a function named areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
//      Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.
function areaOfCircle (radius, pi) {

// EXERCISE 5
// Write a function named runAll that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier
//      1. Take half of the number and store the result.
//      2. Square the result of #1 and store that result. 
//      3. Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.   
//      4. Calculate what percentage that area (#3) is of the squared result (#2).
function runAll() {
 
}
console.log(`Half of number ${numberToBeDevided} is ${result2}`)
console.log(`The result of squaring the number ${number} is ${result}`)
