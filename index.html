    <h1>Javascript Function & Scope Practice Lab</h1>
    <p>Complete the task found below each block of instructions (written as comments) in the Javascript panel of this page.</p>
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>To get started, create a project folder and add the file <code>index.html</code>, with the necessary document template. Create a files named <code>script.js</code> and paste the instructions found in the JS file (panel to the right) into it. Attach that <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> to <code>index.html</code> and begin.</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p> For each exercise, follow the instructions to create a function that either outputs the result to the console using <code>console.log</code> directly in the function, or has a <code>return</code> with the necessary value and is then output to the console from where the function was called.</p> <p>Ideally, try both methods to get comfortalbe with the role of a function.</p>
